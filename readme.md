This is the beginingo of learning flask by doing some small scale pages their rendering and storing the data to the database.


=> Form Storing

 Directory name Form storing , where i learned to create a flask app and all the commands needed to intialize the flask project.

 There i learned to use the templates and rendering them with the inbuild flask function render_template.

 I learned to use the flask_sqlalchemy to store the data in the database, flask_sqlalchemy uses the sqlite:///databasename.db to create a database 

 we can also view the stored data using the sqlite viewer websites and as well as the sqlite command propmt

 we learned to use GET POST like superglobals which are helpful in getting acess to the form components in order to store them.
